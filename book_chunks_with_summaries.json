Between Crowchester and Wastewater,\nbeside whose forbidding great gates he stood, ran the irregular road,\nrising through dunes, skirting wind-twisted groves of pine and fir,\ndisappearing into ragged hollows to emerge again on turfy bluffs, and\nfinally winding in here toward the old brick house that lay hidden\nbehind these high walls.\n\nOn his right lay the shore, rocky, steep, rough, with pebbles\ncomplaining as the tide dragged them to and fro, surf hammering\nrestlessly among the rocks or brimming and ebbing with tireless\nregularity over the scooped stone of the pools. No two inches of it,\nno two drops of its immensity ever the same; it held him now, as it had\nheld him for so many hours in his very babyhood, in a sort of tranced\ncontemplation.\n\nThe sun was setting in angry red beyond the forest behind him, but a\nhard and brilliant light still lay on the water, and the waves were",

Where the old brick wall of\nWastewater descended to the shore enough sand had been stored in the\nlee of the wall to form a triangular strip of beach, and here scurfy\nsuds were eddying lazily, hemmed back from the tide by a great jammed\nlog and only stirred now and then by a fringe of the surf, which formed\nnew bubbles even while it pricked the old.\n\nOn the sharp irregular fall of the cliff, distorted, wind-blown\npines and tight-woven mallows clung, with the hardy smaller growths\nof the seaside: blown blue lupin, coarse sedge and furzy grasses,\nyellow-topped odorous sage and dry fennel. About their exposed,\ntenaciously clinging roots was tangled all the litter of the sea:\nropes, slender logs as white and bare as old bones, seaweeds, and\ncocoanut shells.\n\nDavid breathed the salty, murmuring air, faintly scented with fish,\nlooked back once more toward the shining roofs and the rising faint\nplumes of smoke above Crowchester, shrugged his shoulders with a\nphilosophic laugh, and turned again toward Wastewater’s gates.\n\nThese were four: two great wrought-iron wings in the centre, where\ncarriages had once entered and departed, and, designed ingeniously in\nthe same enormous framework, two smaller gates, one on each side, for\nfoot passengers.\n\nThe carriage gates had been closed for years and were bedded deep\nin dry grass and fallen leaves, and the right-hand smaller gate had\nperhaps not been opened three times in its more than one hundred years’\nexistence. But the left-hand gate stood slightly ajar, and beyond it\nran a faintly outlined footpath into a deep old garden. The whole\nelaborate structure, met by the mossy brick wall on both sides, was\nthick with rust, its scrolls and twisted bars shone brick-red in the\nlast of the sunlight.\n\nDavid had walked briskly from the village and his blood was moving\nrapidly, but he shivered as the familiar atmosphere once more\nenveloped him. Once again the dilapidated, stately old garden with its\nbottle-edged flower beds, where the ragged rose bushes were already\nshowing red and yellow hips, where the pines were shedding their\nslippery needles, and where the maples and elms looked tattered and\nforlorn.\n\nThe place had been thickly planted almost two hundred years ago; it\nwas densely overgrown now; the trees crowded each other, and the\ngrowth underneath them was sickly. The old path was spongy with wet\nleaves underfoot, and the air so pungent with their sharp odour as to\nbe almost anæsthetic. Between the blackened trunks on the right David\ncould again see the serenely moving, deeply breathing surface of the\nocean, but now the garden and low cliffs shut off the shore.\n",

The last dying\nfires of the sunset, burning through black tree trunks behind it,\nseemed only to make darker than ever the outlines of the great dark\nred brick house, three-storied and with a steep mansard as well, its\nuncompromising bulk enhanced rather than softened by a thickly wooded\ncoat of black ivy.\n\nIt was an enormous old Georgian building, impressive for size if for\nnothing more. Wastewater’s twenty acres stood on a sharply jutting\npoint of cliff, and the house faced the sea on three sides; the garden\nwas shut off from the road by the long western wall. Immediately back\nof the kitchen and stable yards there was a rear gate, buried in\nshrubbery and quite out of sight from the house, for delivery wagons\nand tradespeople.\n\nThe main entrance was on the eastern front, facing straight out to sea,\nbut this presented now only rows of shuttered windows and stone steps\ndeep in fallen leaves, and David stopped instead at the stone steps of\nthe columned side door. Leaves had littered the paths and lay thick\nupon the struggling grass of the rose beds, but these three steps had\nbeen swept clean, their dried surfaces still showing the marks of a wet\nbroom.\n\nDavid, absorbing the details with the eye of one who perhaps is\nreluctant to see confirmed previous impressions or fears, shrugged\nagain, made a little face between impatience, amusement, and misgiving,\nand gave the old-fashioned iron bell-pull a vigorous jerk.\n\nThen came a long wait. But he did not ring again. The first fifteen of\nDavid’s thirty-one years had been spent here, within these grave old\nwalls, and he knew exactly what was happening now inside.\n\nThe jerk on the brass-handled wire would set into convulsive motion\none of a row of precariously balanced bells far down in the enormous\nstone-floored kitchen. Most of these bells had not been rung for two\ngenerations at least. They were connected with the bedrooms and the\nstudy--it had been a long time since any resident of Wastewater had\nfelt it necessary to summon a servant to bedrooms or study. In the row,\nDavid remembered, were also the front-door bell, dining-room bell, and\nthe side-door bell. He began to wonder if the last were broken.\n\nNo, someone was coming. He could not possibly have heard steps behind\nthat massive and impenetrable door, but he assuredly sensed a motion\nthere, stirring, creaking, the distant bang of another door.\n\nThen another wait, not so long. And at last the door was carefully\nopened by Hedda, who looked casually at him with squinting old\nwhite-lashed eyes, looked back in concern at her bars and bolts, closed",

How is Mister David?”\n\n“Splendid,” David answered, with a heartiness that the chill of the\ndark old hall already tinged with a certain familiar depression.\n“Where’s my aunt, Hedda?”\n\nHedda had been staring at him with a complacent, vacuous smile, like\nthe slightly demented creature she really was. Now she roused herself\njust a shade and answered in a slightly reproachful voice:\n\n“Where but upstairs shall she be?”\n\nDavid remembered now that Gabrielle had long ago announced, with her\nprecocious little-girl powers of observation, that “Hedda always tells\nus things the first time as if it were the twentieth, and her patience\nquite worn out with telling us!” An affectionate half smile twitched\nthe corners of David’s mouth as he thought of that old tawny-headed,\nrebellious little Gabrielle of ten years before, and he followed the\nsmile with as sudden a sigh.\n\nHe mounted gloomy, wide old stairs through whose enormous western\nwindows a dim light was struggling.

I can never nap in the afternoons.\nI hear--voices,” she finished, as if half to herself.\n\n“Lord, one realizes how lonely the old place is, coming back to it!”\nDavid said, cheerfully.\n\n“Not for me,” his aunt again corrected him in her quiet voice that\nseemed full of autumnal reveries and the quiet falling of leaves\nitself. “Other places are lonely. Not this.”\n\n“Well, it’s extremely nice to know that you feel so,” David pursued,\nresolutely combating the creeping quiet, the something that was almost\ndepression, always ready to come out of musty corners and capture\none here. “But when the girls are home we’ll have some young life at\nWastewater, and then--when they marry, you’ll have to move yourself\ninto brighter quarters--into a city apartment, perhaps!”\n\n“When they marry?” she repeated, slightly stressing the pronoun.\n\n“As I suppose they will?” David elucidated, looking up.\n\n“They?”\n\n“Sylvia--and Gabrielle, too!” he reminded her.\n\n“Oh, Gabrielle?” She repeated the name quietly. “To be sure, she will\nmarry,” she said, musingly. “But I can hardly feel that quite as much\nmy affair as Sylvia’s future, David,” she finished, mildly.\n",

Certainly!” she answered, sharply. And\nsuspiciously she added: “What makes you ask that?”\n\n“It has sometimes gone through my head that there might not have\nbeen--that that might account for her despair and her death,” David\nsuggested. “Not that it matters much,” he added, more briskly. “What\nmatters is that here we have Gabrielle, a young thing of eighteen,\napparently all over her early frailness and delicateness--at least, I\ngather so?” he interrupted himself to ask, with another upward glance.",

Janet was then\ntwenty-two, weeping, helpless, alone--unless the four-weeks-old baby\nin her arms might be considered a companion. This baby had been David\nhimself, fatherless since five months before his birth. Exactly seven\nweeks after her tearful and black-swathed arrival in the house of her\nkinsman, Janet, David’s young mother, had married Black Roger Fleming\nof Wastewater.\n\nThere had been quite a houseful of relatives, all more or less distant,\nthere to receive her, for in the comfortable fashion of a past day the\nrich young heir of Wastewater had felt himself responsible for his less\nfortunate kin, especially his women kin; and more than that, it had\nsuited his somewhat feudal ideas of hospitality to gather the entire\nclan about his big dining table.\n\nSo David’s mother had found Roger with a stately, withered little\ngray-headed second cousin--his uncle’s widowed daughter-in-law--“Aunt\nJohn,” keeping house for him, and assisting her a dark-eyed, vivacious\ndaughter named Flora, and a smaller, more delicate, and timid daughter,\nLily--third cousins, if relationships were to be traced.

For it became\nevident from the first that the new Mrs. Fleming would not bear her\ntitle long. The city doctors, one after the other, gave her illness the\nname of a lingering and incurable malady, but Cecily herself knew, and\nperhaps Roger knew, that it was youth--youth forced too soon into the\nrealities of loneliness, responsibility, passion, and fear--that was\nreally killing her.\n\nPlacid, uncomplaining, sweet, Cecily lay on a couch for months and\nmonths, sometimes worse, sometimes so much better that she could walk\nslowly up and down the garden paths above the sea on Roger’s arm. Aunt\nFlora, David remembered, had been living in Boston then, where Uncle\nWill had some temporary position, but Flora came back to Wastewater\nfor the long vacation, bringing with her her own baby, the lovely\nblack-eyed girl that was Sylvia; “even then the little thing was as\nproud as Lucifer himself!” thought David, reaching this point in his\nrecollections with a smile.\n\nFlora and her tearful little sister Lily and the baby did not go back\nto Boston in the winter; they would join Will “later on after Cecily’s\noperation,” they said. And even David knew that “later on” might be\nonly when Cecily was dead.

In other rooms there\nwere odd bits, some good, but almost all very bad: majolica, onyx,\normolu, terra cotta. There were one or two good pictures, forty bad\nones: seascapes with boats, still-life studies of dead fish, English\nnobility of the First Empire days, breakfasting in gardens, peasants\ndoing everything ever done by peasants, old woodcuts of Queen Victoria\nand “Yes or No?”, “Dignity and Impudence,” and Mrs. Siddons, curling\nand water-stained in their heavy frames.\n\nThe books that filled the handsome glass-doored shelves in the dimly\nlighted, mouldy library, where light crept as into a cave, and where\nthe air was always damp and heavily scented with decay, were almost all\nruined after some especially wet winter.

Gay saw that she had turned a deathly colour, and was\nbreathing badly, and she told herself remorsefully that such a query,\nhurled unexpectedly into the silence, might well terrify any nervous\nelderly woman, living alone.\n\nEager to simplify matters, she recounted her odd experience on the\nvery first night after her return.

And Gabrielle, beside him on the\nfront seat of the little car, with a crate of eggs steadied at her feet\nand two quarts of whipping cream held firmly in two bottles in her lap,\nlooked up at the scudding sky and thought with exhilaration that it was\nprobably true, and that all the company, and David, would be here in a\nfew hours, to make merry in Wastewater and defy it.\n\nShe picked and seeded raisins for an hour in the kitchen before\nluncheon, and came to the meal with her cheeks red and her head hot,\nand after luncheon went out into the woods, where a genuine colour\npresently stung the warm brunette skin to glowing, and where wrestling\nand tugging with obdurate saplings made her tingle from head to foot\nand push her hat back from her damp forehead, laughing and panting\nwith the tussle. Aunt Flora had said, with one of her rare touches\nof companionship, “I would just like that empty corner of the hall\nfilled up--some sort of branchy thing----” and Gabrielle had been only\ntoo glad to make it her business to fill it. She had left her aunt\n“resting,” as unusual an employment for Flora as were the flush on her\nface and the wire curlers in her hair.\n\nEveryone in the big house had been wrought, now, to a pitch of\nexpectation bordering upon fever. The last plate was washed, the last\nspoon polished; the shelves of long-unused pantries downstairs were\nloaded with cakes and pies and cold meats and bread and sauces and\ntrembling jellies; the big rooms upstairs were aired and warmed; there\nwere fat comforters folded invitingly across the foot of the big,\nfreshly made beds; there were open fires and stove fires everywhere.\nFloors shone with wax; palms moved green fronds gently in well-dusted\ncorners; lamps were filled, clocks were ticking busily. Gabrielle felt\nin her veins the excitement that is a part of physical strain. She,\nlike everyone else, was tired, but it was a happy sort of fatigue,\nafter all.\n\nOn this last afternoon she had gone a little deeper into the woods than\nwas necessary, or than she had planned to go for the last greens,\nas a glance at her wrist watch showed her. It was already half-past\nthree o’clock when, with her arms full of fragrant boughs, she started\nback toward the house, perhaps a mile away. The day had grown a little\ncolder, the wind had steadied to something like a gale, and the\nsea--for she never was quite out of sight of the sea--was in an uproar,\nrunning high and wild, breaking furiously upon the rocks, and flinging\nitself twenty feet into the air when these stood fast, as they had\nstood for a thousand years.",

I declare, you can’t see twenty feet in\nit!”\n\nGabrielle shouted back, fled upon her way about the big north wing,\nthrough a sort of tunnel of dry branches above an arbour already\nheavily powdered with white.\n\nHer thoughts were all on the house, all intent upon reaching the side\ndoor, all upon the necessary stamping, shaking, disburdening herself\nof outer garments and her branches of snow; it was after four now, she\nmust be ready in the velvet dress when Sylvia came at six----\n\nSuddenly she stopped short in the lonely side garden, where the snow\nwas falling so fast, recoiled, and heard her own choking exclamation of\ndismay. Something was moving in the snow, something bent and whitened\nwith flakes--but human! Gabrielle’s heart almost suffocated her, and\nshe felt her throat constrict with pure terror.\n\nIt was a child--it was a little old woman, doubled up with years, with\nwisps of white hair showing about a pallid old face that was scarcely\na wholesomer colour than they, or than the falling snowflakes. She had\nher back half turned to Gabrielle, and was creeping along against a\nsort of hedge of tightly set firs, her old black cape or shawl topped\nwith white, her thick shoes furred with it.

It was almost like\nthe cry of a wind-blown gull, and here in the unearthly solitude and\nquiet of the storm it frightened Gabrielle with a sense of forlornness\nand horror. The house, only a few feet away, with fires and voices,\nseemed unattainable.\n\n“Come in--come in!” cried Gabrielle, guiding her with a strong young\narm. “You’ll die out here--it’s a terrible night!

Take her--take her to the kitchen, Hedda, and\ngive her some tea, and I’ll be right down!”\n\n“Imagine!” Gabrielle said, eagerly. “She might have died in the storm,\nthe poor old thing!”\n\nThe old woman had been turning herself uneasily, looking with rapidly\nblinking eyes from one to the other. Now the servants were gently\nurging her toward the doorway that led to the warm kitchen regions,\nand to Gabrielle’s amazement she seemed to be displaying a weak\ndisinclination to go.\n\n“Who’s this girl, Flora?” she said now, in a cracked, querulous voice.\n“You stop pushing me, Margret!” she added, fretfully.\n\nIt was Gabrielle’s turn to show amazement and consternation.

I would rather you didn’t mention it to Sylvia,\nGabrielle, by the way.”\n\nGabrielle, after a bewildered upward glance, of course agreed never to\nmention the circumstance to Sylvia--indeed, never to think of the poor\nold soul again.

Only\na few weeks before he had felt it would be an injustice to speak to\nSylvia, Sylvia the beauty, the heiress, barely of age. But Sylvia had\nbeen brought into his own zone, in some strange manner, during these\nChristmas holidays; for the first time in her life David had seen her\nas perhaps needing affectionate guidance, sympathetic advice, as indeed\nthe young girl she really was, for all her superiorities.

But Sylvia was\ndifferent, she had been born balanced and conscientious and intelligent\nand industrious, she needed softening now, and the interruption of her\nown serene and unquestioned will. There was beginning to be just a hint\nof the pedant, just a suggestion of the rut, about her.\n\nIt was sweet to him to think that with his love for her, his knowledge\nof her affairs, his happy familiarity here at Wastewater, he might\nactually give to a marriage with Sylvia more than any other man was\napt to give. That confident, straightforward decisiveness of hers was\nexactly what led so many fine women into ridiculous marriages. He could\nimagine Sylvia seriously telling him that she was about to marry some\nengaging penniless idler: “He’s a count, you know, David--one of the\nfinest families in Europe!” Or perhaps she would not marry at all; she\nhad said laughingly of some young admirer months ago, “Possibly he\nheard of Uncle Roger’s money, David!”\n\nThat wouldn’t do, either.

A cold bright moon moved over\nthe packed snow, and the sea swelled with booming, sullen rushes over\nthe rocks. Clocks seemed, to David, to stand still; to mark strange\nhours.\n\nWhen Gabrielle had put her young arm about the shrinking, withered\nform of the harmless old feeble-minded woman that David did now indeed\nrecognize as Aunt Lily, for some reason he had felt his throat thick,\nand his eyes blind with tears.

They had had some contented rainy mornings together, in the\nbare upstairs room he called his studio, and they had sometimes played\na sort of double solitaire in the evenings, Gay as anxiously excited\nas a child, and saying “Oh, fudge!” when the cards fell wrong, in a\nlittle baffled, furious tone that always made him laugh. He and she had\nthought the weak little mother and the worthless, wandering father long\nago vanished from her problem; the child had quite a sufficient problem\nleft, as it was! And she had faced it so bravely, faced it cheerfully\neven with the constant reminder of Sylvia’s contrasted good fortune,\nSylvia’s wealth, Sylvia’s impeccable parentage, right before her vision.\n\nNow, suddenly, while her heart was thumping with the shock and terror\nof awakening from sleep to find this dreadful apparition in her room,\nshe had had to accept this same mowing, gibbering, weeping old woman as\nher mother. And David loved her that she had not hesitated, where for\nsheer bewilderment he knew he might have hesitated.\n\nShe had not glanced at Aunt Flora, who was leaning sick and silent\nagainst a chair, nor at the cowed and white-faced old Belgian servants,\nnor at him. Quite simply she had put her arm about poor Aunt Lily,\ntouched her young lips to the yellowed old forehead where the forlorn\nwisps of grayish hair hung down, and then turned, steady-eyed and\nashen-cheeked but quite composed, to say quietly:\n\n“Where does she sleep, Aunt Flora? In that room where I saw the light?\nI’ll go up with her--she’s shuddering with cold, she’ll be ill.\nI’ll--you’ll go with me, won’t you, Margret? We’ll get her to bed.”\n\nFor Margret, also pale, in a gray wrapper, and looking anxiously from\none to the other as if to read in their faces what had occurred, had\njoined the group from some rear doorway.\n\n“No, that was partly it, Gabrielle,” Flora forced herself to say, with\nchattering teeth. “She hasn’t been so bad until lately. And after you\nmet her, that day, we moved her into the back of the house--someone\nwas always supposed to be near her. You shouldn’t have gotten out of\nbed and come through the halls in your bare feet, Lily!” Flora mildly\nreproached her sister. Lily clung stubbornly to Gabrielle’s arm, but\nthey were all moving slowly in the direction of the rooms Flora had\nmentioned now, through the bitter darkness of the halls. The lamp,\ncarried by David, sent their shadows wheeling about the angles and\ncorners ahead of them, doors banged, shutters creaked, and when Lily’s\nchattering whisper of complacency and exulting triumph was silent,\nthey could hear Hedda and Trude telling Margret that the sick lady had\nwandered into Miss Gabrielle’s rooms in the night and frightened her.\n",

David built up the fire while they\nput the poor little chattering creature to bed, and Gabrielle, without\nseeming to be even now conscious of anybody’s presence but that of her\nmother, caught up an old ivory-backed brush and massed the straying\ngray hair into order, pinning it, David noted pitifully, with the pins\nthat had held back from her face her own thick, rich braids. There was\na tenderness, an absorbed, gentle, and childish pity about her whole\nattitude the while she did so that made his throat thicken again.\n\nMeanwhile Margret and Hedda, evidently well used to this ministry and\nmoving about the room with an air of being entirely at home there, had\nsupplied Lily with hot-water bottles and some sort of milky hot drink\nwhich Lily fretfully complained was bitter.\n\n“It has her sleeping stuff in it,” Margret explained, in an aside. Lily\nsmiled knowingly at Gabrielle.\n\n“They wouldn’t mind poisoning me a bit, dearie,” she said, in a loud\nwhisper. “At Crosswicks they used always be trying to poison us.”\n\nHowever, she took the drink, when Gabrielle held the glass, in short\nsips, meanwhile patting the girl’s hand, beaming, and occasionally,\nwith increasing drowsiness, recalling old memories.\n\n“Gabrielle had a little gray coat and a hat with gray fur on\nit--beaver, it was real beaver--it looked so good with her golden\ncurls!” she said once, complacently. “Roger said she looked like a\nsquirrel. Where is Roger, Flora? Why don’t he come up some night, so’s\nwe could all play euchre, like we use’ to?”\n\nAnd at another time, some moments later, she added, in a sweet and\nnatural voice: “I was looking all over the place for Tom. He gets my\nnasturtium seeds and eats them! But I don’t know where all this snow’s\ncome from. It was real sunny yesterday when I put them out, and Roger\nand Will were in swimming!”\n\nAll this time Flora had sat in an armchair by the stove, with one hard,\nveiny hand tight over her eyes. Margret lessened the lights, Lily began\nto sink into sleep, and Gabrielle sat timidly down near her, still\nholding her hand. The servants slipped away, but still Flora did not\nstir.\n\nWhen Lily was so soundly off that their voices did not disturb her,\nDavid touched Gabrielle’s arm, and stiff, and looking a little\nbewildered, she rose noiselessly to her feet.

None.\n\n“Well, these windows at least can be closed!” Gay decided, with\nchattering teeth. The night struck through her thin nightgown like\na wall of ice as she struggled with the heavy blinds.

The creature\nhad somewhat the shape and feeling of a little muff, but was stocky,\nwarm, and wriggling, with a little eager red tongue coming and going,\nand an entreating whine for whosoever stopped to finger his soft little\nhead.

But Gabrielle was alone,\nyet curiously imprisoned in this dreary old silent place, tied to the\npoor little invalid who rarely identified her, and to dismal, quiet\nAunt Flora, and to all the ghosts and echoes of Wastewater.\n\nTied, too, to an unceasing contemplation of Sylvia’s perfections,\nSylvia’s good fortune, Sylvia’s charms. Sylvia would be home in June as\nthe daughter of the house, and the heiress; already some papering and\npainting was being done in preparation for her return; she herself had\nselected papers and hangings in Boston weeks ago.\n\nGabrielle had borne bravely the initial shock of discovering her mother\nbut she weakened as the slow, cold weeks went by, let her music go,\nneglected her books, wept and brooded a great deal.

He\ncould not mean--but he _could_ not mean that he meant to ask her to\nmarry him?\n\nThis would be preposterous; it certainly was not that. Yet as Gabrielle\nremembered the phrases of the short letter the horrible conviction came\nto her that her suspicion was justified. He was engaged to Sylvia, or\nat least there was between them an understanding more or less definite;\nthat was what he meant by Sylvia’s part, Sylvia’s “coming into it a\nlittle.” And the rest was between him and Gabrielle.\n\nOh, he could not intend to hurt her so terribly, to add this\ninsufferably humiliating thing to all that she was enduring now!\n\n“I don’t believe it!” Gabrielle said aloud to the gulls and the sea.\n“David wouldn’t do it.

It was enough to turn his heart to\nwater, and he formed within his confused mind a solemn resolution not\nto fail her again, not to offend, to watch this timid little seedling\nof returning confidence and friendship reverently and tenderly; to keep\nthat at least, if he might have no more.\n\n“But Anna’s is a sad story,” he said, looking at the book.\n\n“Yes, but I like sad stories,” Gabrielle answered, thoughtfully.",

And Gabrielle, bewildered with the pain of\nhis composed and quiet parting, watching his old belted suit and the\nsturdy, shabby knickers out of sight, said to herself again, “I am\nafraid.”\n\nTom had made her his special ally and confidante of late, and only\nGabrielle knew how far her friendship had been influential in keeping\nhim at home at all. He disliked his Aunt Flora, and felt that Sylvia\nlooked down upon him, as indeed she did. David, affectionately\ninterested as he was, was a forceful, almost a formidable element,\nwherever he might be, and nobody knew it better than Tom. David might\nbe, comparatively speaking, poor, he might wear his old paint-daubed\njacket, he might deprecatingly shrug when a discussion was under\nway, he might listen smilingly without comment when Tom was noisily\nemphatic, yet Tom knew, and they all recognized, that there was a\nsilent power behind David. He was a gentleman; books, art galleries,\nlanguages, political and social movements, David was quietly in touch\nwith them all. He was what Tom would never be, that strange creature, a\npersonality. Even while he nodded and applauded and praised, he had an\nuncomfortable effect of making Tom feel awkward and even humble, making\nhim see how absurd were his pretence and his shallow vanity, after all.\n\nBut Gay was inexacting, friendly, impressionable, and she combined a\nmost winning and motherly concern for Tom’s physical welfare with a\nchildish appetite for his tales. She felt intensely sorry for Tom,\nchained here in the unsympathetic environment he had always disliked,\nand she assumed an attitude that was somewhat that of a mother,\nsomewhat that of a sister, and devoted herself to him.\n\nShe liked him best when he talked of the sea, as they sat on the rocks\nfacing the northeast, sheltered by the rise of the garden cliff from\nthe afternoon sea. Dots of boats would be moving far out upon the\nsilky surface of the waters; now and then a big liner went slowly by,\nwriting a languid signature in smoke scarcely deeper in tone than the\nsummer sky. Tom talked of boats: little freighters fussing their way\nup and down strange coasts, nosing into strange and odorous tropic\nharbours; Palermo, with the tasselled donkeys jerking their blue and",

For a few dubious\nminutes she felt that she had hurt him, but suddenly he began with the\nwhole story.\n\nHe had met Tana when she was only fourteen, just before the entrance\nof the United States into the war. Her father was a native trader, but\nthe girl had some white blood. Tom had remembered her, and when he\nwas wounded and imprisoned, had escaped to make his way back, by the\ndevious back roads of the seas, to the tropical island, and the group\nof huts, and Tana. And Tana had nursed him, and married him solemnly,\naccording to all the customs of her tribe, and they had lived there\nin a little corner of Paradise, loving, eating, swimming, sleeping,\nfor happy years. And then there had been Toam, little, soft, round,\nand brown, never dressed in all his short three years, never bathed\nexcept in the green warm fringes of the ocean, never fed except at\nhis mother’s tender, soft brown breast until he was big enough to sit\non his father’s knee and eat his meat and bananas like a man. There\nwere plenty of other brown babies in the settlement, but it was Toam’s\nstaggering little footprints in the wet sand that Tom remembered, Toam\nstanding in a sun-flooded open reed doorway, with an aureole about his\ncurly little head.\n\nTom had presently drifted into the service of a small freighting line\nagain, but never for long trips, never absent for more than a few days\nor a week from Tana and Toam. And so the wonderful months had become\nyears, and Tom was content, and Tana was more than that; until the\nfever came.\n\nTom had survived them both, laid the tiny brown body straight and bare\nbeside the straightly drawn white linen that covered Tana. And then his\nown illness had mercifully shut down upon him, and he had known nothing\nfor long months of native nursing. Months afterward he had found\nhimself in a spare cabin upon a little freighter, bound eventually\nfor the harbour of New York. Tana’s family, her village indeed, had\nbeen wiped out, the captain had told him. The ship had delayed only\nto superintend some burials before carrying him upon its somewhat\ndesultory course. They had put into a score of harbours, and Tom was\nconvalescent, before the grim, smoke-wrapped outlines of New York,\nburning in midsummer glare and heat, had risen before him. And Tom,\nthen, sick and weary and weak and heartbroken, had thought he must come\nhome to die.\n\nBut now, after these weeks at home, a subtle change had come over him,\nand he did not want to die. He told Gabrielle, and she began indeed to\nunderstand it, how strangely rigid and unlovely and lifeless domestic\nideals according to the New England standards had seemed to him at\nfirst, how gloomy the rooms at Wastewater, how empty and unsatisfying\nthe life.",

She had met it every time she\nlooked up from her cards, and it had finally blotted everything but\nitself from her thoughts.\n\nTom rose obediently, and Sylvia folded his rug for him, and went\nabout straightening the room. The girls were accustomed to perform\nsmall services for Tom, who really was not strong enough to be quite\nindependent of them yet. All three went downstairs together, Gabrielle\nloitering for a few minutes in Sylvia’s room, not so much because\nshe had anything to say as because the nervousness and the vague\napprehension, that possessed her like a fever, made her fear her own\ncompany.\n",

I was afraid any\ninstant that we might be sent away. My mother told me long afterward\nthat I cried myself almost sick with excitement when she told me that\nUncle Tom had asked her to stay and take care of his house for him. I\ndon’t remember that, but I remember in my gratitude telling Roger that\nI hoped some day he would be out at sea in a wreck, and that I would\nsave his life--and how he laughed at me.\n\n“He was, I suppose, as handsome a boy as ever lived--it was not that.\nSurely I was too small a girl to know or care what real beauty was! But\nI loved him from the first instant I saw him.\n\n“Not--I think now--as other children love, as other young girls love.\nThere was no vanity in it--I can say that. There was no happiness, no\nprettiness. It was agony to me, almost from that first June afternoon.\n\n“He seemed to me to be in a class all by himself. Whether I liked it\nor not--and it was years before I realized it fully--I had to keep him\nthere! His least word was important, his kindness made me tremble all\nover, and if ever Roger were cross with me, I used to be actually sick\nwith grief, and my mother would ask him to come up to my room and let\nme sob wildly in his arms and beg him to forgive me.\n\n“I never got any pleasure out of it, God knows. It was constant pain.\nIf he smiled at any one else, I was wretched. No matter what he did,\nhis laugh, his voice with his horse, his use of his hands--and he had\nbeautiful hands!--was full of magic for me. I used to pray--to _pray_\nthat he would not always seem so wonderful to me, that I would see him\nin ordinary human daylight. I never did. He was my whole world.\n\n“So the years went by, and Uncle Tom died, and Roger was the heir.\nRoger was twenty-five then, tall and straight, and so clever that he\ncould do anything! He rode and he sang, he danced and shot better than\nany of his friends. Women were already beginning--ah, how women loved\nhim!\n\n“Will, his brother, had been wild from his very boyhood--from his\nfifteenth year.

From the\nstrange, disorganized winter day of Aunt Flora’s death, Gay had been\nquite simply, affectionately, and appreciatively Tom’s little sister.\nThere had been no scenes, no hysteria, no superfluous words; David did\nnot even suppose that the sister and brother had discussed the subject.\nImmediately, and with a youthful and almost childish grace that David,\nremembering, would recall with suddenly blinking eyes, she had adopted\nbig, clumsy, unpolished Tom. In three days, quite without awkwardness,\nif with a sometimes slightly heightened colour, he had heard her speak\nof “my brother” to doctors, nurses, waiters in the hotel.\n\nShe had carried Tom, he realized now, by storm, by the sheer force of\nher own extraordinary personality. If Tom had ever been in any doubt\nas to the fashion of recommencing their friendship along these wholly\naltered lines, Gabrielle had instantly dispelled it.\n\nMore, she had given Tom as a brother ten times the visible affection\nand confidence that she had been willing to give him in any other\nrelationship. Gabrielle had been afraid to be too friendly before. Now\nshe was free to laugh with him, to spoil him, to tease him, to sit on\nthe edge of his bed and hold his big, hard hand while she recounted to\nhim her daily adventures.\n\nAnd Tom had proved quite unconsciously, by his pathetically eager\nand proud acceptance of this new state of affairs, that it was her",

Indeed, so\nconsummately wise had been this child’s--for David thought of her as\nscarcely more than a child--this child’s handling of the situation,\nthat within a week of the change Tom’s tone had actually taken on the\nhalf-proud, half-chiding note of an adoring elder brother, and David\nhad seen in his eyes the pleased recognition of the fact that at least\nno one else was, or could be, Gabrielle’s “family” but himself.\n\nTom’s condition appearing to be supremely unsatisfactory, there had\nimmediately been talk of southern California or Florida for the winter.\nFor Sylvia, who was strangely shaken, quiet, and unlike herself even\nwhen physically well again, it seemed a wise solution, too.

But by this\ntime Tom was entirely well again, perfectly able to live in the East,\nwinter and summer if he liked, “but catch me doing it,” wrote Tom, in\nhis large sprawling hand, and the travellers had gone into Mexico.\n\n“Do for Heaven’s sake be careful, Gay,” David had written anxiously.\n“You appear to be the brains of the expedition. You may get into hot\nwater down there!”\n\n“Sylvia, on the contrary, is the brains of the expedition, as you so\nelegantly phrase it,” Gabrielle had answered, cheerfully, “and as to\ngetting into trouble--no such luck!”\n\nThen they were in San Francisco again, and David, with a muffled\nhammering going on steadily in his heart when he thought of seeing Gay\nagain, had been expectant of a wire saying that any day might find them",

He\nalways put off the work of answering for a fortnight if possible--but\nsometimes he could not wait so long--to savour more fully the privilege\nhe felt it to be, and to lessen the interval before the next letter\nfrom her.\n\nWhen his answer had gone there was always a time of blankness. David\nwould walk past the Keyport post office, go back, ask casually if there\nwere letters--no matter. But when something approaching a fortnight\npassed, he would find himself thinking of nothing else but that\nprecious little sheet; find himself declining invitations to Boston\nor New York for fear of missing it for an unnecessary few days, find\nhimself wiring Rucker in the latter place, “If letters for me, please\nforward.”\n\nFor the rest, when Sylvia wrote with charming regularity every week\nGabrielle was, of course, always mentioned, and almost always in a way\nthat gave David more pain than pleasure.",

That was two days after we sailed,\nand it was that very night that I was playing cribbage with the old\ncaptain--who was a perfect old Scottish darling!--and afterward went\nup on the bridge with him.
